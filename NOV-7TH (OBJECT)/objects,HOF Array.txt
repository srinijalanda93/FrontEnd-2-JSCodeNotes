NOVEMBER 7TH 
CONCEPT:for in loop (keys/index) ,for of loop (elements)
CONCEPT:object,HOF on Arrays,callback function,predefined HOF..
CONCEPT:predefined HOF on array (additional)=>forEach,map,filter

OBJECT:CURD,iterating on it.
Object are similar to array but we need to make customized indexing
"whole JS deals with the OBJECTS ONLY".
define:object are collection of data associated with keys value pairs..
OBJECT are denoted by curly braces key:value and separated by commas.
-SYNTAX OF OBJECT(C:CREATE)
 let/var/const obj={
    key1:value1,
    key2:value2,
    key3:value3,...keyn:value_n
 };


OBJECT:READ,UPDATE,DELETE:
OBJECT(R:READ)
-Accessing the objects value can be done in 2 ways..
1.objectName.keyName
2.objectName["keyName"] //fall under the customized indexing,always enclosed with dounble quotes (string).

OBJECT(U:UPDATE)
1.objectName.keyName=Value;
2.1.objectName["keyName"]=Value;

OBJECT(D:DELETE)
Object DELETE the value:
-For Remove the values from the object it won't follow splice method.
-it follow delete keyword followed by the objName.keyName
SYNTAX: 
"delete objName.keyName";

//OBJECT iterating on it.
step1:obtain the key from the object=>return in the form of ARRAY
step2:from the above step 1 arrayKey we can access the values

step1:Give the keys in the form of ARRAY
var arrKeys=Object.keys(objName); //Object is built-in constructor keys() is a function
var arrValues=Object.values(objName);

ITERATING USING for in and for of
=>for in :always on keys /index;
=>for of :always on values/elements (it won't run on the objects)

HIGH ORDER FUNCTION(HOF)
Define function:A function is set of code which is reusable
1.increase reability,reusability.
2.function are DATATYPE IN js.
Syntax: 
1.CREATE THE FUNCTION
function fuctionName(parameter1,p2...){
    //code 
}
2.CALLING THE FUNCTION
fuctionName(argument1,a2,a3...);

PARAMETER VS ARGUMENT 
PARAMETER:WHICH TAKE THE VALUES or CAPTURE THE VALUES (declaration of function there we call those as parameter)
ARGUMENT:WHICH PASS THE VALUES (during the function call we call those values as arguments)
NAME CONVENTION OF functionName :alway starts with _,$,alphabet.
-"FUNCTION IN JS ARE DATATYPE"

Type of Function:
1.Named Function->Regular Fun
2.UnNamed Function->Regular Fun (since fun is datatype)

UnNamed Function:SYNTAX
var/let/const variable=function(p1,p2,p3...){}

HOF:A function which takes/RETURNS another Function is called HOF
CALLBACK :A function passed as argument into some other Function Function is called as CALL BACK FUNCTION.

in array we have some built-in method=>push(),unshift(),pop,shift,slice(si,ei),splice(i,c,v1,v2..) =>NOT HOF
SOME ADDITIONAL built-in methods on ARRAYS=>forEach,map,filter,reduce...

/**
 * forEach =>  ( n => length of the array )
 *      Takes a cllaback function and invokes that callback for `n` number of times.
 *      returns nothing.
 * map    =>
 *      Takes a cllaback function and invokes that callback for `n` number of times.
 *      returns another array of same length.
 *
 * filter =>
 *      Takes a cllaback function and invokes that callback for `n` number of times.
 *     returns an array of any length
 */

forEach() :it is used to iterate the give  Array and it used for ARRAY ONLY.
1.forEach() always take one mandatory Argument which need to be FUNCTION.
2.the function (which is passed an  argument ) into forEach it take 3 parameter
=>mean say during the invoking process the function(which is passed an  argument ) take 3 parameter.
3 parameters=>elements itself, index of ele,arry list... so these 3 values are given to the forEach
3.forEach will not RETURN anything.. returns=>undefined..

Example:
let arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6];
let callback=function(){console.log("stmt")}
let x=arr.forEach(callback); //runs based on arr.length

here forEach method takes other function(callback) 
internally the function which is passed as argument
involved based on the give array length 

Map method on Arrays(HINT :need to extra same array  length)
1.similar to forEach =>take the callback function invoke length no of times.
2.BUT returns another array of same length.

internal work of map(f(){}) during the executes of map()
step1:creates an array of the same length;
step2:and return undefined (if don't specific) in the array

filter =>
 *      Takes a cllaback function and invokes that callback for `n` number of times.
 *     returns an array of any length
 =>only returns the  boolean (true) vlaues only in the form of array
